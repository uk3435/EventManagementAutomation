# EventManagementAutomation
This project's components automate tasks which are triggered by event management system (OMi). I wrote a nodeJS server app (which is called rpaServer) to receive http request from Event Management System and then forwards requests to related RPA (robotic process automation) robot. I also added a Queue structure to hold rejected requests to resend to RPA robot.
